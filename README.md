# FAQ
**Q: Is Millennium allowed by Valve? (Will I get banned?)**   
A: Using Millennium to customize your client is safe. As noted on the [Official Valve Software Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Skins):   
> "As the official skin support (for VGUI) has been removed... it was unofficially replaced by Millennium for Steam... an open source patcher that allows skins/themes after April 27th 2023."

**Q: Can I find this in the [Millennium Plugins Browser](https://steambrew.app/plugins)?**  
A: Not yet; once I've polished this up further, I will submit it for review to be added to the official store.  

**Q: Can it show who gifted me the game?**  
A: Unfortunately not. Outside of the original gift message and email, Steam does not store the "sender" information in a way the client can retrieve, so I cannot display it.

## Acknowledgments
A special thanks to **[HLTB for Millennium](https://github.com/jcdoll/hltb-millennium-plugin)** for executing another plugin which places game-specific tooltips: it made a great study/starting out point, especially for the observer and injection logic.
