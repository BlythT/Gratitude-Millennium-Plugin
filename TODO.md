# TODO
- [x] Get user consent for persisting game license data to file (required for millenium plugin DB submission)
- [x] Persist data to Millennium approved dir (currently steam config folder) (chose `F:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\plugins\gratitude` with a fallback of `F:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\plugins\`)
- [x] Make non-loaded cache more obvious
- [ ] Make game license data cache per-steamID (bug right now if you swap accounts, shows previous accounts gifts as yours if you own same game)
- [ ] Standardise date format (Last Played is Mar 5, 2025 while Gratitude is 5 Mar, 2025)
- [ ] Submit to [Millennium Plugin DB](https://github.com/shdwmtr/plugdb)
